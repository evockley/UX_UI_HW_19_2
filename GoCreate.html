                <h3>What is this?</h3>
                <p>For years, Men’s fashion, tailoring, and custom clothing have been on a growth trajectory. This
                    App redesign is a bit of a passion project as well as an attempt to update an existing order
                    system for salespeople to communicate custom clothing orders with a workshop worlds away.</p>
                <p>Using the existing interface, orders can take as long as 90 minutes to submit for some users. I
                    knew this problem intimately because I led this department at my company. The order system was a
                    negative touchpoint for users which caused errors that ultimately led to a negative customer
                    experience as well.</p>

                                Custom clothing salespeople have an antiquated order system that is cumbersome,
                                confusing, and difficult to use. Contextual inquiry has shown that it can take as long
                                as 90 minues
                                to submit a single order.
                                The frustrating experience effetively disincentivizes users from making sales in the
                                department.

                            <p>I wanted to retain the many details associated with custom clothing while allowing
                                users
                                to

                    <p>This was an interesting case in that I had significant professional experience in this
                        industry before working on the project. I knew some of the observable issues that my
                        colleagues had with the system. I focused my research on finding underlying reasons that
                        were not simply observable in a professional evironment. </p>

                <h4>What I learned</h4>
                <p>I found that Users' reluctance to use the order system came from a desire to be confident in
                    their order process. They wanted to serve their customers to the best of their ability and
                    maximize their earning potential by speeding up the order process.

                <h4>What I learned</h4>
                <p>The number of details involved with custom clothing means that there are a LOT of inputs that are
                    absolutely required to create a new order. Some of the data points are not required, but
                    optional. For example, each customer will not need the same alterations, but a user must have
                    easy access to any alteration whether it is used or not.

                <p>Betwen the time I began the project and the low-fi stage, the company purchased iPads for
                    salespeople. I learned how critically important it is to make sure I'm creating responsive
                    paradigms from the very

            <p>Quentin, a veteran custom clothing salesperson, met a prospective client, Jonathan at a wine
                tasting event. The client was perfect for this clothing program, so Quentin gave him an overview
                and his business card and invited him to the store. Jonathan came in a few weeks later and spent
                a couple of hours shopping around and getting fitted for a new jacket. He mentioned that he
                needed a wardrobe overhaul as he had just lost a lot of weight. Quentin wanted to get this order
                right because he takes pride in his work, but also because there were multiple sales on the
                line.</p>

            <h2>II. Definition</h2>
            <p>There are obviously a vast number of pages that would ultimately need to be accounted for in an audit
                of
                the entire interface. This project redesigns the Orders flow of the interface. Other important
                functions
                include checking fabric, lining, and button stocks, maintaining/updating customer contact
                information,
                viewing order histories, monitoring order status, and if necessary, viewing how-to pages for less
                experienced salespeople. In future iterations, I would ideally like to merge the “how-to” section
                with
                the “orders” section so users don’t have to abandon an order or open a new tab to learn something
                they
                don’t know.
            </p>
            <p>Below, the categories highlighted are part of this flow to demonstrate how a redesign of the app
                might
                work.</p>

            <h3>User Flow</h3>
            <p>The User Flow was iterated based on feedback from users. My initial attempt at a user flow included
                fewer
                screens as that was one of the main pain points from users. However, I learned that the number of
                screens wasn’t really the issue. Users were happy to interact with more screens if there was less to
                do
                on each and fewer opportunities for error. In the fit tools module, there is more than one option
                per
                screen available, but when a user selects an individual alteration, an overlay screen makes it the
                only
                available interaction point. This approach tested well.</p>

            <p>
                Interviews revealed that users need more confidence in the system before they’re willing to trust
                it. It
                became imperative to design with ease, feeback, and error prevention in mind.

            <h3>Early Sketches</h3>
            <p>I hypothesized that I could eliminate much of the confusion of the existing interface by removing the
                screen clutter and making the experience more visual. I also wanted users to feel like they were in
                control of their own order.</p>

            <h3>Wireframes and Pivot</h3>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>I ultimately moved forward with the search bar interface for a few reasons:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Users don’t need to interact with each dropdown on the Fit Tools page. </li>
                <li>It was the most streamlined way to eliminate all the visual clutter from the page</li>
                <li>It was the best way to show users only the alterations they wanted for a specific order</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="imported-graphic">
            <img class="wireframe-images" src="images/GoCreate/Fit-Tools-v1.png" alt="v1 Wireframe" width=75%>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>However, my first round of testing wasn’t met with a lot of enthusiasm from users. Between the time I
                began the project and this iteration, the company purchases iPads for each employee. Now, rather
                than
                going to a back office and entering orders, users were now expected to enter orders on their mobile
                devices.</p>
            <p>This presented a new set of problems. In addition to the challenging interface, users needed to
                interact
                with it on a device with a smaller screen (no, it wasn’t responsive design), and with added
                disctractions to their workflow.</p>
            <p>I needed to come up with a new solution.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="imported-graphic">
            <img class="wireframe-images" src="images/GoCreate/Fit-Tools-v2.png" alt="v2 Wireframe" width=75%>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>Luckily, my sketches included something that sort of looked like tappable cards, so I adapted that
                approach for an iPad. Now, rather than relying on a searchbard (and therefore keystrokes), users
                were
                now able to tap plus and minus icons to increase or decrease a measurement. The most used
                alterations
                are on the first page, and users needing more obscure alteration can find them tucked away in tabs
                using
                standard industy language: Posture, Circumference, and Length.</p>
            <p>This tested better, but I still wasn’t entirely happy with this approach—it still offered too many
                opportunities for error in a busy environment. I iterated further to remove the plus and minus icons
                from this level. In the revised version (below), a user taps into each alteration, where there are a
                large plus and minus button on either side of the image.</p>

                I’ll
                keep working on the project to introduce some features that will address anticipated issues: what
                happens if a customer orders two jackets in the same purchase? What if there are 5 shirts that are
                all
                styled different using the same fit? What happens if a fabric is sold out?</p>
            <p>Many more interesting usability challenges deserve to be tackled so these users can have a great
                experience with their workflow.</p>
