        <h2 id="bio-heading">Bio</h2>
        <p class="bio-p1">Coming to design, I bring a lifetime of essential human-centered skills to my UX practice. As
            a musician, I crafted performances to evoke emotional responses in my audience. In my fashion career, I’ve
            served people
            from all walks of life at companies large and small. I found success in getting to the heart of their
            problems, nurturing relationships and creating smooth end-to-end user experiences. As a custom clothing
            specialist, I have vast experience
            delivering products people want.</p>

        <p class="bio-p2">I have studied Product Design and earned certificates from General Assembly and The George
            Washington
            University. Previously, I earned a Master of Music degree from Carnegie Mellon University. Colleagues past
            and present have described me as a methodical, adaptable, naturally curious people person.</p>

                <h3>User Interviews</h3>
                <p>All those years in sales have paid off. I’m highly skilled at idenifying what I don’t know and
                    working out a way to figure it out, including crafting interview plans and rolling with the punches
                    to identify user needs.

                <h3>Rapid Wireframes</h3>
                <p>I’m a believer of the pencils before pixels mantra. I sketch ideas so I can test them early with
                    paper prototypes. Sketches often fail, but I learn from failures to move forward more effectively.

                <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                <p>With my background, competitive analysis comes naturally. Musicians listen to musicians for
                    inspiration and education. In fashion, we evaluate competitors to identify areas of differentiation.
                    I apply these perspectives to my design practice.

            <h2>What I'm Exploring Now</h2>
        </div>
        <p class=learning-now-p1>Every corner I turn as a designer leads to a longer reading list and inevitably more
            corners. I constantly
            assess opportunities for growth and seek out resources to help me master new skills and deepen my
            specializations.</p>
        <p class=learning-now-p2>I’m a designer (and person) who believes in lifelong learning and growth. In addition
            to the fact that
            designers must continue to learn to keep up with technology and current trends, It’s also just a lot of fun
            to learn!</p>
        <div id=learning-now-right>
            <p>Here’s a few areas of interest I’m pursuing now:</p>
            <div>
                <h5>Front-End Development</h5>
                <p>Java Script</p>

            <div>
                <h5>Typography</h5>
                <p>Just getting started!</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>Information Architecture</h5>
                <p>Navigation Systems</p>
